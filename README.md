# Word Scrambler

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start` both work

### Current Bugs:
* if you don't finish the words in order it messes up the scoring system. Trying to implement a disable feature so only the current word is enabled
* Update: fixed the scoring system, if it gets messed up it renders correctly on click of the next button, still would be nice to add disable feature as mentioned above
